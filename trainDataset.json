Yet it failed to hold its promises quickly turning into unstable enterprise app. Voice calls are call-and-pray. Accepting calls on mobile device means you won't be able to use your iPhone for anything else - app just quits after several seconds of being in background even if call is active. I've tried to allow background activity in settings etc nothing worked. Channels are not sorted in way any human being would expect. There's no way to sort channels on last received message. If your enterprise grows app quickly become unusable. In my case I had to hire at least two more people just to keep track of what's happening in the slack. Not to mention app crashing sometimes or eating up one CPU core sucking battery on the laptop. We've been using slack for years now and I have to admit relying that much on it was a huge mistake. Internally we've been discussing even developing our client just to make it stable and usable."

The message writing is just abysmal. List and font formatting in particular have bugs with years standing that can result in a long message being a total loss or only recoverable by copying and pasting into another app fixing then returning. Except long messages and text selection in Slack iOS seem effectively incompatible again due to bugs or interaction glitches. Some kinds of simple list and text formatting easily done in Slack for desktop or the web app are simply impossible in the iOS app. Not because of limitations or missing features. Because of old old bugs. If the Slack apps for the desktop and for the web are Slack's A-games this cornucopia of frustration is their C game. At best."

Apps with one developer get this right.And please don't tell me to contact support or submit some diagnostic via the app. I've done this at your request for years and am told it will be looked into. Nothing at all ever gets fixed but you just keep adding new features. You need to take a step back fix all your fundamental issues and then move forward with more features."

Isn't it a basic rule of app and UI/UX design to avoid making the user tap and click extra to get to the good stuff? There's no paywall so why change the nature of how Slack loads and what screen it loads to? Why add extra steps for the user to get where they want to go? I otherwise really like Slack I like making custom emojis and it's become a major messaging app for me and friends. However 1-star for Slack adding more sifting through and clicking and waiting for things to load then clicking into names every time. It's a totally unnecessary frustration. Also intermittent glitches on iOS that don't seem to read a long press on the most recently sent message and sometimes just one in a batch of messages any reason for this? It's a new iOS problem in 2020."

But the current way it's set up makes me not want to use it and triggers my ocd. I get frustrated every time I receive an alert.

Coders can code and create shortcuts artists can create little emojis to use to react to chats tech novices get a guide to what the tech world looks like without making it too complex to use... I use it for an online bootcamp a class of about 20 people (plus teachers and TAs) and it's has got to be the best way to organize! Set reminders for a class or for yourself in the app create a group giving who you choose more access to to edit the chats (like admins) ask questions easily using /create_ticket set up automated bots to notify you whenever a tag (like /create_ticket) is used so that you can help quickly and keep organized etc..It is truly an app that is perfect for school or work chatting.

        "input": "Look I loved Slack. I've been using it as my internal business communication tool for the past five years. I've also noticed in those past five years Slack has barely innovated and as of recently especially during 2020 when most applications like zoom Google meet and Microsoft teams have been booming with innovation in new ways of interacting in this new work from home work life. Now with the acquisition from salesforce I truly feel like Slack is going to go down the drain and what was once the industry leader in communication has sat back on the couch slacking watching everybody else move forward. As of today we are looking into other platforms outside of Slack due to the lack of innovation and buy out from sales force. An example of what I think is easy innovative feedback we've been asking for voice clips to send both privately and in channels up to 2 to 5 minutes long so managers can leave a status update or important message or daily briefing first thing in the morning without having to type it all out and can do it on the go nothing. It was nice while it lasted slack."

I can barely get started on the app because there are so many asinine hoops to jump through for literally no reason. And any change I make is basically permanent to the point where if I make a mistake with workspaces I basically have a delete my entire account and do it all over again. You'd think that it would be so much easier to use a regular messaging interface but this is atrocious- why not just use Discord? It's literally the same thing without the headaches of random extra steps. Why is it so difficult to join a group it literally doesn't make any sense I have to authenticate my account four or five times for it to just send my in random circles to try and join workspaces AND even then it won't let me join. Horrible app just use iMessage."

        "input": "I have such a deep love-hate relationship with Slack.I only use Slack on iPad and iPhone but mostly on iPad. There are a few key places where it falls down:- Not being able to create/edit Posts is ridiculous. It's just editing text come on.- If you background the app for 30 seconds it marks you as Offline. This means it's hard for my team to tell if I'm actually online or offline as I'm almost always Offline in Slack.- The app needs to be updated to support the iPad pointer natively. It works but there's no optimization for it which feels broken compared to any other modern iPadOS app. (Also text selection with the iPad pointer is very difficult because Slack doesn't use native standard elements.)- There's no way to create or reorder Sidebar sections on iPhone/iPad.- Slack actually has great keyboard shortcuts but it's inconsistent with the Mac client. Should let me switch Workspaces and should allow me to Reset Cache. That's all high-level stuff. There are lots of other things I'd like to see but have little-to-no faith that I ever will. For example I'd love for Slack to have Shortcuts support such that I can create an automation that sets my Slack status. That's an example of something I feel like Slack would have jumped on 5ish years ago but doesn't care to do anymore. (Let alone something as fundamental as adopting the system iPad Sidebar or have a native Mac app.)These are all negatives. I actually really like Slack it's a critical business tool for me that I enjoy using. It's just not a joy to use as it continues to drift from what I expect a native iPad app to support."

They fixed it but now the speakerphone will turn off randomly after a few seconds. So pretty much I have to enable speakerphone every few seconds which is really annoying and makes the feature unusable.This particular bug has made my workflow a real pain. Slack seems to be making my work harder rather than easier to do. Not just this bug‚ other bugs as well as the server-side outages Slack seems to have frequently."

Slack needs to hire someone who knows how to create an easy to use UI.============================For some unfashionable reason the iOS app splits the list of channels I'm in into two groups: ones that have unread messages and ones that don't.That's not the case with a Mac app.The result is that there's A TON of scrolling back and forth trying to find the channel I'm looking for since it can be in two places: with new messages and without new messages.Then there's starred channels which have the same problem.The UI is a nightmare. I spend more time scrolling through twice as many items on my list of channels than I do on my Macbook! And there's no option in settings to disable this.I'd complained about this issue several years ago - and nothing has changed since then.That's why my company is switching to Microsoft Teams."

Yo to be honest when they first came out with some of newer type features back in the day I thought they were just trying to please to many people BUT....I was wrong. Its incredible and with the custom integrations from everything from HTTP to cal events you're pretty much set I mean I even use the pins to highlight different things my colleagues mention in passing so I can quickly come back or (more honesty) be able to remember those things altogether. Slack honestly has improved my coding productivity we appreciate you guys! We had to tell our CEO today about the good fight and why we pay for slack premium member benefits today and it made me think people ought to know.Thus I'm here writing this review doing my part. Because YAL NEED TO KNOW it's awesome I thank you slack!"

The integrations are too complicated and you often find yourself wading around like where am I? and where was that message? ... things seem to disappear when you navigate away. And so much content seems to accumulate all over the place and whether there is truly a new message waiting for you or not and where the heck is it is often a mystery. I'll sometimes encounter messages from a colleague or in a team room that are days old and scratch my head why didn't I see these or wasn't notified? I often avoid using Slack and opt to use our simpler internal communications tools because I am afraid messages will just get lost or missed by the receiver that's a sign of a failed tool.And why isn't a voice integration standard like Microsoft Teams? Some of my company has it set up and some parts don't. Therefore nobody really knows if you cannot cannot do voice calling or meetings in your Slack context/rooms so we simply don't. Which brings me back to simply using our previous corporate tool which does it all seamlessly where I don't miss things and don't have to guess about the functionality and switch in and out of different tools. How Slack can be worth so many billions is beyond belief for a tool that's such a jumbled mess. I guess Salesforce is probably the right owner - another jumbled mess of disorganized and outdated tools that are over-hyped."

They keep changing everything every week and moving and replacing every corner of the app. The moment you get used to doing something it changes again in a totally incompatible way. To makes matters worse it's absolutely full of bugs everywhere. Anything you do is buggy or problematic. Using this app is extremely frustrating and bothersome. It's supposed to send text messages to people but somehow has become a superset or email presentation software a CRM a task manager a pager a todo list and a whole bunch of other unrelated functionality. I dread having to use it or dare try to find a message that someone sent me. Absolutely awful and I wish I could stop using it but my company is forcing me. Email was so so so much better than this crap."

Previous conversations with other members or groups of members seem to stay listed in the left hand pane with no easy way to clean them up. it would be nice if we can set a time limit after which those historical conversations can at least be archived or moved to a different list that is not normally visible. When I want to send a message to a particular individual or small group I have to use the ad button at the top of the screen multiple times to select those people. It would seem more convenient to me to have that member list be an expandable list on the left-hand side and I simply need to select or check off the members who I intend to send a message to. So basically I think the functionality is great but the organization and layout of the application itself just seems clunky. Even the appearance and spacing of messages and replies isn't usually segregated enough."

This should be available in the sidebar as an option but should not have replaced the existing functionality which was much simpler and faster.For example: if you wanted to use Giphy prior to the update you were able to type /giphy [search criteria] submit it and pick a gif you wanted to send. It was clean and simple.This same process now looks like this:Type the slash character which takes you to a fullscreen Shortcuts modal. Search in that menu for Giphy. Tap giphy. Tap if you want to search random or pick a gif. Search within Giphy. Then  tap shuffle as needed. Then finally...send your gif.From a UI/UX perspective simplicity is always a goal but as a general rule if you're adding extra taps/clicks you are likely overthinking the feature and it will be rejected by users. This feature really should have been tested by more general users prior to rollout because there simply isn't enough upside to rollout this feature while eliminating the existing functionality/simplicity.Please move the Shortcuts menu to the sidebar or simply revert."

Updated rating however Dev team should test builds before rolling out to the public especially for important features such as your presence status. Original Review:  Switching between active and away no longer works since the last release. When the selection is chosen it just highlights it but doesn't change the status. Force closing the app and immediately changing the status works only sometimes. I've already tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and the problem still persists. Based upon the reviews in the App Store it appears that this problem is not isolated to me. Hopefully the dev team can fix in the next release"

If I'm trying to type a slash command assume I know what I'm doing and leave me the heck alone. The way it works now it totally disrupts my workflow so that I don't even want to use slash commands at all.Also markdown in the mobile app doesn't work properly. As an example if I type *this* to bold something it ignores the trailing asterisk and bolds everything.In general the app is also sluggish. Messages often fail to update quickly (like I'll see the current messages on desktop but mobile will be out of sync).For the amount of money Slack charges (for the plan we're on) it's frustrating. Slack hasn't provided anything meaningful to improve the experience. If we didn't have so many third party tools integrated with Slack we'd probably have switched by now."

No joke i invited a dozen people to watch me change the password on the computer (since that's where our work emails are) and then...the app says wrong password. Despite a dozen people having just watched me set the password with the password I then tried to log in on. Slackbot is an affront to technology and a waste of resources. The app itself crashes constantly the ability to actually reply to a thread or navigate in a way that makes sense is completely non-existent.  If you're an individual get the original. If you're a company well the original app this was cloned from is free and works significantly better."

Many of our team are mobile and while the developers themselves are most always at a desktop managers and attendees on calls are not - and are unable to view and follow along on the product and issue demos.  Because of this meetings are now scheduled outside slack on other services like MS teams and GoToMeeting which support viewing from iPad. Once meetings started to move from slack more communications continue to move out.  Our use case makes sharing from iOS a very very low priority but viewing other presenters shared screen is a must have.  Without this feature I find I must only give slack 3 stars.  Otherwise notifications work well and messages are solid other than missing multiple levels of bullet indents to make readable lists."

Now I have to look for my message and I feel that it's not user friendly because now you have to go all the way to the top almost to get back to your message in progress. Also through the app I can't find how to set myself to away without having to snooze myself. Thank you!"

I have to first download? Why can't I drag an image from the web straight into slack? I have to first download it then find the file and upload into slack???Finally: Overall bugginess. Almost every day I have to quit and restart slack (Mac) because it is doing some wonky thing. Not answering calls no audio not calling someone else correctly on the iOS app I tap hang up a call 4-5 times and it slack just sits there with its mouth hanging open doing nothing. With all this said I have no viable alternative to this essential tool and couldn't live without it. I just feel like (as Steve Jobs once said about Adobe Flash) their developers are LAZY."

You can't make channels that are visible but locked to everyone. Especially annoying for channels like announcements and rules where I don't want conversations starting. Paid. I run a little server for local teenagers we can't afford any of the paid plans. The server is active and bustling but soon we'll run out of visible archive space and won't be able to view old material or conversation.   iOS has been buggy for me I'll see a message but Slack won't erase the notification or acknowledge that I've read the message. Only happens once or twice a month but still irritating."

Well recently I have seen feature changes that just make it harder to use. For example typing slash to run a command now brings up some dialog box to help you but its janky and clumsy and I was fine with just typing. I used to be able to swipe between chats with two fingers. When i am talking to multiple groups a lot this was a god send. This doesn't work now and i have to go find each conversation in a list when i want to switch. Super annoying to have time savers be changed or removed. It is so much more noticeable than when a new feature that works well gets added."

Notification: replying to a notification looks like it's working but the reply never actually goes anywhere. Recipients often think i'm being unresponsive but it's just Slack slacking (as usual). Other products are starting to encroach on Slack and soon we will be using so many others to fill in the bugs and gaps in Slack that we will just stop using Slack.

I only sporadically get notifications for new activity and it's usually after I've already opened the app unprompted that the notifications suddenly appear all at once. It's annoying ineffectual and has made me look less than great at work on a few occasions now. If it weren't for the fact that my whole organization uses this app I would never use or recommend it.

I love how i can change my profile picture name workplace info choose privacy and notification settings can set myself as away and all my notifications come in once I'm active have a dark mode enabled (this saves my tired eyes first thing in the morning) and an all the way around fun place to communicate with others.I don't leave many reviews and this is one of the only ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è reviews I've left.

You can't collapse any channel groups and when you get a new message in any group they duplicate the group and show one group with all the new messages and the same group below with all the channels that don't have new messages. It's aggravating to have to always scroll through the groups and channels when you're trying to find a channel in a group that DOESN'T have any new messages. It's like Slack hired developmentally disabled half-blind antagonistic Chimpanzees to develop the user interface for this app. And did I mention that you can't get to ANY settings in the app? They just don't provide an option for you to manipulate any of your profile settings at all. This app is annoying at best...."

In desktop app when I go to channel that I haven't opened for some time it's opened right where I left and I get to scroll down the conversation. In mobile app however the conversation is opened with new messages so I have to scroll up which is not really intuitive and convenient at times. It would be really cool if in mobile app the conversations were also opened where I left off and I got to scroll down. Great work otherwise."

        "input": "This app would be great if it wasn't for the dreadful issue with notifications. I have been using this app for over 3 years at this point. And everything about the app itself is nice and feature-full. It has message channels a desktop version file sharing formatting search history a nice interface etc. However when you send a message you can pretty much guarantee it will not be seen any time soon. The actual message is sent but nobody will notice until they open the app themselves manually. There have been too many times when important messages have been missed and time has been wasted. Due to this we have had to resort to standard text messages for any critical or important messages. I have been holding out hope that this issue will one day be fixed but at this point I've given up. This has been a problem since at least December 2018 but from what I can tell from searching the internet this goes back to 2016. We have followed all instructions given by Slack about battery optimisation settings etc but these have made no difference. This is the only messaging app that has any issues with push notifications so I feel this must be an issue with the app itself. Until Slack do something to fix these issues I advise users to be aware."

Instead I have to keep two tabs open in Chrome (for the 2 teams I'm a part of) each of which chews up between 300-500 MB of RAM during the day - no!Would love to see this in the next / a future update. Other than that great app and still 5 stars! dO_Ob"

No amount of restarting the app or my system has helped. I'm sure it's amazing my friends and colleagues who use it say it is but I wouldn't know because there's some flaw in the programming. I'm on a brand new system so I'm sure I can't be the only person experiencing this. HUGE fail for a company seeking to create a platform that simplifies our lives."

We use Slack as our central hub and all our other key services integrate into it (such as SVN Jenkins Jira and Zoom). Between this and Zoom we have a very nice virtual environment with great team collaboration!Two big requests to make it perfect:1. I would love to be able to add URL links to the sidebar so that my team can also have quick access to important team and/or company links such as our Confluence documentation video tutorials IT support ticket/email etc.2. I really wish the mobile app had quicker access to jump between teams like the desktop app does (by having the teams sidebar thing appear on the left side). It is a chore to keep switching between teams on the mobile app because of how burried/nested the functionality is to switch.Keep up the great work!"

The keyboard shortcuts are odd and the lack of parity with the rest of the truly native applications is painful."

We employ a large number of external developers and partners and Slack has made it exceedingly simply to communicate with one another. The groups are great and have much more complexity avaialble if you take advantage of it. Slack is about it's integrations. We've integrated it with a number of applications and they work flawlessly. Let me give you an example. Slack supports integration with appear.in. With the integration anytime you want to have a quick video conference with someone to either talk and see each other or share your screen you simply type /appear and press enter and PRESTO you have a room created. Click the room title in Slack and you're set and in the video conference! No app to install no EULA to accept nothing. Simplicity personified. If you haven't given Slack a try in your organization do so and see how it gets adopted."

        "input": "I work at a small accounting firm with about 11 staff members. Before Slack we used a hodgepodge of methods of communication such as texting gChat email and phone calls. However now that we have Slack it's significantly reduced the amount of time I spend just using my thumbs to communicate missing an email that just needed a quick response or looking at the phone buzz and wondering if this will be a short or a long call. I never have to take my hands off the keyboard now and I can quickly respond to the team or send out easy clean messages in the various channels whether they're at their computer or on their mobiles.I'm not a security expert however I do really like that if ever an employee leaves the firm I can pull them out of our Slack group. In contrast to texting where a sensitive piece of information might be stuck and that staff member's phone or computer for good even after they leave with Slack I can edit or erase old messages or revoke their access completely. Thumbs up.Last thing I'll say is that it's really helped our team collaboration. We have channels dedictated to our tax software quickbooks team meetings or just random fun events happening in everyone's lives. Even though we don't have a physical office location we still feel connected when we see the little green dots by each others' names. P.S. I really love the integration with Asana and Screenhero (and giphy). Those are just icing on the cake. P.P.S. I also find their commentary on app udpates hilarious. Go read them sometime."

Given the choice I would make it half as wide and collapse or at least reduce the width of the left column which is probably 25% wider than it needs to be.  At present if my company chooses to switch from Skype to Slack then I'll be forced to position around 30% of the Slack client off of the right side of my screen or perhaps find a workaround.  I submitted this as a bug over a year ago received a human response but nothing changed.  I'm pretty sure this change would be very easy to make and would improve this product for all Mac users.  Why much this thing be so much larger than its contents?"

However slowly but surely his extensive career has been a large declining red line on the chart tracking quality over time. Unlike the famous actor, Slack's new releases are always packed with new (pleasant) surprises each update solving a problem you didnt realize they had adding features you didn't realize you needed. Their writing about their new updates are always entertaining to read and my faith in their team is always growing. They also seem to remain relatively scientology and couch-jumping free. Their use of hoverstates are efficient and effective never over-explaining but pin pointing necessary tips. Their sense of hierarchy within the messages windows are very nice tracking back in the history is a breeze (I do wish there was a way for me to jump back to a certain date easily. Perhaps a date picker that appears when I click on the date headers inside the messages.Thanks Slack for not being Tom Cruise."

I deleted the app cleared my local cache changed settings in the web nothing would fix it. Eventually I had to google around and use the command line to remove a bunch of settings files. I'm a developer so I was able to figure it out but a non-technical person would have had even more trouble. This is an unacceptable flaw.

I can't get chimes or notifications to play with any regulariy on the desktop app OR on iOS.  No notifications.  No chimes.  And my preferences are set to Notify on any activity.  Have been on email with tech support for the past week.  This is a dismal situation because I need to get notifications on the channels I am tuned in to but Slack's tech support says you EXPLICITLY WILL NOT get those notifications on your devices if you have them open on the desktop app.  W T H?  It also REMOVES notifications from the iOS notification history after some time for some reason so you can't tell if you got any or not.  Imagine going out to lunch bringing your device and NOT getting emergency notifications BECAUSE you are tuned into the channel you care about on your desktop app.Slack creates lots of problems for us because of this.  And my first experience with the app?  Here it goes first when trying to sign in I could not see ANY channels in the left hand pane and to way to get my login credentials.  Then when logged in there was no left hand pane and no way to see it.  Now notifications from other team members do nothing.  No notification chimes are played even though I have set them MANY TIMES.  I have Do Not Disturb disabled yet this piece of garbage puts my conversations with my boss in snoozed mode and there is nothing I can do to disable this.  It is not possible to open another window on the Mac to put a conversation chat or channel chat in.  Randomly replies from team members will not list the who wrote it.  This.  Is.  A.  Massive. And. Aggravating.  Piece.  Of.  Pure.  And.  Utter.  Garbage."

I work in places where admittedly the internet is fuzzy. But reconnection time for Slack seems noticeably slower than other applications. Perhaps not the best tool to use when internet is on and off."

With the browser blocker (We have to log in once for our browser) Slack doesn't work.in 2.3.1 it just shows a white screen never getting further than displaying a white screen.  When I go to their website and download 2.3.0 I have to approve each and every group.  Takes several tries to get every group open then it will work until the zscaler timeout at which time i have to start agin.Seems like they changed their proxy and display methods and are not corporate friendly anymore."

I don't even want to go too deep I just find myself trapped in this app because my company uses it but it's a horrible Mac app a mere thin web wrapper that violates probably 1/2 of the HIGs and pretends to be really funny with release notes. As a web app it's trapped in the world of a web engine which are not necesarily very memory friendly. Keyboard shortcuts are hard/impossible to remap in many instances. It's also relatively buggy from time to time so things will really look broken (CSS?) and you have to close/reopen to fix it. It's a fancy simplified modern IRC but implemented like a bad webapp in fact you could likely use the web version and it would be the same experience except for the lack of ability to Cmd+tab  to slack. International Keyboard support broke months ago and no fix in the horizon. Typing ``` to enter code blocks is broken and a fourth ` appears. Reactions? Very important to have people add a parrot on drugs to my comment. Drag and drop and press shift to quickly upload? Works half of the time if you do it fast and so you end up with the dialog and have to re-do it again or just not use quick upload because it's a hassle. This used to work before it got broken months ago around the same time they broke English-US Intl keyboard. Their audio calls‚ they are appropriate but if the audio interface is stereo with independent channels it only sounds on one side because again it's a web-app and they are being lazy instead of doing what a native app would do. (For the record other web-pseudo-native-apps have the same problem but not all).Anyway You're probably gonna end up having to use this app anyway because work (I mean I don't imagine anyone using this just to talk with friends) so welcome to the club.Additionally in the latest update they changed the incoming call window to appear on the main screen instead of the display where slack is just because they believe this is a bug I guess they don't understand the concept of having more than one display. If I wanted your crappy HTTP call window to appear in front of what I'm doing I would have kept slack there. Who in their right mind thought that having a pop-up in the middle of your screen was a good idea? I have my slack on a secondary display for a multitude of reasons one is because I can't have it uninstalled but since I need it then I put it aside so it doesn't distract me from you know actual work. I disable notifications because I don't like popups all over the place when I'm concentrated. I will check your silly messages when go back to slack not when the other person wants."

The elimination of so much debris i.e. texting email collaborative documents here and there makes this App a perfect basis for any team work regardless of team size.

Its editor's ability to write/present code in various platforms is exceptional.  Everything is archived forever and searchable!

It seems that contracts are considered two words in Slack (why?!). I recently realized that Slack has fixed this bug. Thank you!"

What's more it's working incorrectly: some of the English words are highlighted in red as if there is a mistake (such as then templates kind etc.). It's occuring to Russian as well. Sometimes you type text from your keyboard fast and don't pay attantion to the words but later you notice that one or several words in a message you've already sent have typos which makes you get back to it to edit.

When I sent a request to their support team they responded with:When these emoji are included in Slack messages from iOS or macOS devices that support the newer emoji they may show up as a base emoji plus gender identifier or as a little blank square. This is obviously not ideal and while I can't guarantee **when or if** Slack will support the newer emoji and emoji variations it is something that we're looking in to and hope to include in a future update.

Also a big fan of the styling makes work chat less boring!However noticed with recent update that the Slack Helper processes are chugging CPU time so much so that the fans on my top-spec Macbook Pro run on medium to high. Didn't have this issue before so I'm sure this is an optimization they just need to make.One thing I would LOVE to see is the ability to sleep a group so that it didn't have to be always running in the background. For someone like me who uses Slack for 9 different groups having each of those chats actively run leads to each spinning up a Slack Helper process that consumes a fair amount of CPU. Would love to be able to sleep  less important chats e.g. disable background updates for those groups until I explicitly un-sleep  it. This would primarily be used for chats of lower priority than others."

I'd been deleting music I never listen to clearing podcast emptying anything I could but space would still be decreasing. As it turns out Slack stores logs on your hard drive and I can't figure out what for or how this was allowed via any preferences or settings. The folder is buried deep seemingly through Users>Library>Containers>Application Support>Slack>logs (I can't remember the exact path or find it again as I've just deleted the app and the folder). I discovered this folder while using DiskWave to see what was causing so much storage usage and then confirmed it by following the same filepath in Finder and right-clicking for Get Info. There were 34 gigabytes of storage space being used for logs and I couldn't find anything in the app that explained where they were coming from or why. I deleted the app because of this but there were some other issues I had one being that Quick Look for links has never worked. When I'm in Safari I can do a three-finger tap to get a pop-out quick view of whatever link someone shared without having to open a whole new tab. But in Slack (and honestly several other apps like Tweetbot and Discord) the three-finger tap for Quick Look will select only a few characters from the link and give you a dictionary definition or wiki search. If the storage issue can be fixed or explained so I can disable it I'll reinstall the app. But for now I'll just be using the web app instead."

When it's on the Web it's normal but on the desktop the app is fighting with a lot of other software for the valuable space. I would've made a Slack Widget that sits somehwere on the corner and pops up when you need it. Or at least an ability to hide left sidebars."

However the inability to organize channels into hierarchical folders or even one level of folders is a serious productivity killer. We have about 50 channels so hunting for the right place to put information can be a hassle. We already use prefixes (e.g. dev_XXX or partner_YYY) but that isn't a great solution and it does little to reduce the visual and cognitive clutter. The team has been otherwise helpful with bugs we've encountered but hasn't been able to move the needle on folders. Hopefully they will get to this important feature. Otherwise Slack is great."

The Mac app works well with notification center but a recent bug (Dec 2017) is REALLY annoying. Replies in the notification center now go nowhere. U P D A T E ! Bug squashed as of Jan 2018. Replies are acting as they should. Thanks!!! BTW Notification Center can be set to make Slack notifications persistent so you never miss a message. I can't find a way to do that on colleagues running Windows 7.  Also its nice to know that the developer listens to customers (paying or not) so if you expand to the paid tier you'll get good service."

While some of the feedback about how this app is a little sluggish are valid it's also true that it's a sleek app a big improvement over using the browser (who wants extra tabs open anyway?) and an absolute no brainer for anyone with multiple accounts they need to switch between quickly. File sharing video calls threads all are working well and I definitely recommend this app. Thanks Slack!"

        "input": "I was a late adopter to slack. And yes I may still have a few other tools for a similar purpose simply because not everyone else is on the slack train. But I have put this stuff through the ringer. And 5 stars doesn't mean it doesn't need improvement there are a ton of features I still want to see in the thing. However I love it I'm a convert and I want people to know how I feel about it.Communication : I really like being able to reach out and poke  someone. Just fire of a message and have it there. The interface is slick it's easy to look back through conversations and it makes communication almost delightful. Usability : I have had people of all technical capabilities get on this tool. I use it for all of my clients ( where they don't already have a solution adopted and if they do I try to convert them to slack ). It's easy it has some awesome options to keep things simple and yet still have a lot of access to more advanced capabilities. It's pretty. Also it's on every single one of my devices. It is SO AWESOME to be able to sunc between all my devices.Extesnsibility : For the nerdy folk Slack has an awesome API. I have been able to interface all my main tools ( like project management software build tools product notifications ) through custom API development. It takes mere moments to get a connection and get data flowing. Their documentation is surprisingly good too. And support is has been responsive and helpful.I love this tool One fo the few I'll stick my neck out for and tell folks about. Get it use it keep it!"

I just read a post where the dev team said they had to make hard choices about slack and that allowing for a wide selection of themes didn't make the cut.  Fortunately there are plenty other chat tool dev teams out there that have figured out how to customize their interface so there are choices.Threading is terrible.  I've yet to see a team that is able to be disciplined enough to put every message into the appropriate thread for the entire discussion.  Give us an option to drag it a message into a thread and add it to the discussion.  Even when a thread is on going it is buried in the initial thread with the responses tracker making the discussion difficult to follow especially if you are in several discussions at once.  I understand that that's probably what the All Threads is intended to cure but that just becomes a long running mess of a discussion as well."

The big missing feature is a lack of integration for the ability to speak notifications out loud at the very least the key words. Also there's no way to actually correspond with their support team. You can send them a comment/question but you don't enter your name or email address so there's no way for them to contact you."

It takes forever to open slows down your computer and none of the UI follows platform conventions that other Mac apps and the Apple guidelines encourage them to do. As a developer the reasons why are obvious so let me be clear that I'm asking you to make a native Mac app please. :)"

I love all the free features it comes with but it be great if I have more privacy features for my team and clients. Because each user has a profile with contact details it prevents me from mixing my teams together with other teams and clients. I have to create several Slack accounts for different teams/clients.  I don't need my clients contacting everyone directly or vise versa. For paid because I work with such a large team it would be too expensive to upgrade.  But if I could pay a flat fee $20 up $50 a month just for that feature (ideally $25) I would pay to keep my team's contact details private and limit use of DM between each other and clients so I can add clients and team members to one channel and limit what my clients can do and DM. To pay per account is not realistiic it's way too many people.  Please add this feature it would be so great and I would pay a flat fee for it! :)   I'm still giving 5 stars because the value deserves it. This would just take it to the next level."

It's aesthetically incongruent with the dark mode on Mojave and at night can be very hard on the eyes. The ability to make it black/dark grey would be nice but what would be better is to make it fully customizable at least to the point the way the sidebar is.Functionality-wise I wish we could organize channels. On my workspace users (there are 60 ) can each have their own channels and it really clutters up the sidebar. Putting them into categories would be nice as well as the ability to minimize said categories or mute entire categories.Lastly full account/workspace management within the app. It's strange to me that in order to modify settings etc. that I have to open a Safari window. However I think the other two issues I mentioned are much more important for day to day use.Otherwise I like the app and what it does. Minor adjustments to the UI would make it great and full management in app would make it fantastic."

Hope this feature is on the way. Thanks for listening."

Seriously how hard is it to adjust the style sheet? I've read that Slack is just a glorified Chrome app. Older versions of slack could be hacked to display better why not the latest? Seriously this looks like amateur hour. Update: Slack got back to me stating this is on their radar. Yeah far as I know it's been on the radar  for years. Come on guys just do it.Second is the channel ordering on the sidebar. The scienfific  ordering bears absolutely no resemblance to how I use the channels. All I want is the channels I use most frequently at the top. And those with unread or tagged messages filtered higher to the top. Right now the placement seems random. My most common channel usually makes it to position 1 or 2 but the rest are all over the list Channels I have never posted to show up higher than ones I use most every day. If I reply to a message in a channel it usually drops to the bottom of the list."

However the lack of dark mode now well over a year after Slack stated they were 'working on it' is ridiculous. Most modern applications now have a dark mode feature. Most developers want dark mode and utilize it heavily on all other platforms. This is consistently asked for by Slack users and yet Slack refuses to truly prioritize it. Until dark mode is enabled Slack has earned a one-star rating from me. It's simply unacceptable to continue not making an easy and highly pleasing change to the platform."

        "input": "Slack is a great example of bad design. It has functionality and it works okay but the interface is incredibly confusing. I click on ( ) for channels but it wants me to create a new channel. Oh I was supposed to know that I have to click Channels to look at existing channels. But for Direct Messages clicking on the title and the ( ) do the same thing. (Don't get me started on the Mobile App because it's 10x worse. I barely know where to tap to do anything.) It enforces channel names to be channel-name to make it seem like IRC when nothing else about it is like IRC. Again Direct Messages don't enforce this because usernames can be anything. Another annoying feature is the Drafts. If you start writing something and navigate away you spend 10 seconds looking for your channel/DM until you find the draft you forgot you were writing. Nothing is consistent or pleasurable about this software. There's no dark mode unless you download a script from github even though Mojave came out ages ago. Just add the dark mode already! Another annoyance is that you can't join public channels. You have to receive an invite before you're allowed to join. Again another way it fails to behave like IRC.Obviously there was a need for improvement but the design is so bad I hope we move on to something better. But yeah emojis are cool."

Don't bother switching if you already have a chat service.Major beefs include: the slack bot is crazy annoying and there isn't a way to turn it off. If you have multiple teams it's slow to manage and clear all your notifications. Single chats get lost in the silly draft mode section. Common channels get lost among all the other channels in big organizations. I could go on.I've reached out the Slack about these issues and their response is always a blow off. Don't expect the app to get any better over time."

        "input": "Slack is an okay app but the team behind it appears to loathe their customers.  This is a bold claim but when you have a company that has known it users wanted night mode/dark theme since 2014 (check their Twitter for 10 Nov 2014) not added it yet because doing accessibility is hard for 4 years and then has a Product team with the nerve to harass its customers on Twitter (Kump on 8 Jun 2018) for expecting them to follow through like a quality Mac app - what is the right way to categorize this attitude?Maybe your Product team should spend more time fixing the accessibility issues you appear to find unsolvable for 4 years instead of scoring snarky Internet points.EDIT: Around a month later & reading both the Developer Response as well as Slack's own Twitter it seems even clearer to me that the company still doesn't value its customers. The inability to not only provide a temporary solution providing takedowns on solutions like Sblack that work around your non-delivery and the lack of a firm commitment on a date on which you'll have any solution due to rearchitecture just makes this crystal clear.  I for one will be pushing my company to move to other solutions like HipChat or Discord.EDIT 2: Mojave is now shipped & Slack still won't commit that they will do it on Twitter (...do want to support it. Unfortunately we can't say if or when that will happen).  Best look at Discord or other alternatives.EDIT 3: iOS has Dark Mode & macOS got a refactor but still no Dark Mode.  Slack just use Catalyst on the iOS app & kill the Mac product in September.EDIT 4: Updating from 1 star to 3 stars as Slack has finally come through with Dark Mode in Sept 2019.  Would up it to 5 star if their Dark Mode actually respected the OS Dark/Light setting instead of requiring me to personally go into Preferences and set it to the appropriate type.  Why Slack Product/UX why?EDIT 5: Changing to 5 star as there is now a way to enable Slack to respect the OS's appearance preference for Dark vs Light.  You have to opt-in (it's off by default) but at least it's there."

Once there I'm directed to go back to Slack. Since Slack basically runs in a WebView why can't it all be done in-app? It defeats the purpose.2. When I hang up the chat window says I'm In a call on another device even though I'm really not. The other device (an iPad) remained locked for the duration of the call and was not used even though I am logged in on it.3. No MS Outlook integration.

Furthermore its text editor is absolutely incompatible with any other text editing interface and it is impossible to migrate information from another service to Posts or vice versa. I have begun to rely much more heavily on other collaboration and note-taking software the more that I've had such disruptive experiences."

But today it got stuck in the code format and I had to reach for the mouse remove the word retype the word without formatting then hightlight the word and format it. So much less efficient. Also when doing multi-line code formatting (formerly three backtickets ```) I have to press return three times to end the formatting and send.Please please please give us an option to turn this off. It's great for the marketing department but terrible for programmers."

The app especially has a lot to offer in the tech industry with reliable features including but not limited to automated webhook integration into a channel informative code/text snippets and can't forget its video call feature (which I still kinda use to this today)!Highly recommended for all your work and community needs."

Making ...* Messages are very hard to find again* Hard to respond in a threaded message style i want to comment about the topic 25 messages ago.* Memory respource hog. On my mac latest OS it uses 400Meg each on 2 helpers.  The help pages are not much use. I followed the instructions to not show images unless i click on them that's got it down to 75Meg for slack and 175Meg for the helper.* Will Not Run as an app or in chrome on MacOS 10.9.5. That was myt home office Covid19 machine. Con in the way we use it: Team members treat it as a perminant record of information - which it is not. Not Slack's fault here."

I swear it worked better as a separate product.Calling in Slack in my biggest complaint I wish it was more reliable when it comes to the screensharing portion of things.  More often than not the screenshare will freeze requiring the meeting to restart or sometimes requiring the toggle of just the screenshare component.  It also uses up an extremely high amount of system resources causing the fans in my MacBook Pro 16 Core i9 to go crazy.  A little optimization would be nice.I am writing this review today though as I continue to be annoyed by these problems that haven't been solved for years.  Google Meet and Zoom don't have issues like this.One last thing your cool app update messages in the AppStore change log aren't very cool.  Why not actually tell customers what you are fixing instead of trying to be so creative while avoiding the disclosure of information.  I feel like transparency is a little warranted in today's climate to help build trust in our industry.  I for one would like to know what you are fixing so maybe I can feel better about the platform as a whole in case I have encountered or been affected by problems that may have been fixed."

My team is right around that cusp so if we need to invite others to our meetings we have to switch to something else.I hate how they moved the video call button in channels to be hidden behind another button. Don't know why they changed that it was better before. If I had known I would not have upgraded.The drawing feature is useful when someone is sharing their screen but sometimes it draws a double image and then you can't tell what the user is pointing to. Please fix this annoying bug.I like the quick edit feature by hitting up arrow and then editing your last comment. I also like how easy it is to add an emoji reaction."
