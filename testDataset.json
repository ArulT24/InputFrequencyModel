It is really hard to find the correct direct group message when many of them have overlaps.2. Please! Please! Please support LaTeX rich text editing!3. Also please allow the users to export chatting data to disk it feels more safe this way!4. When I set a reminder it is good that I get confirmation feedback at the very bottom of the chat but maybe not a good idea to mark that feedback as unread because after using the reminder once the user would know where the reminder is setting it as unread would be unnecessary.Thanks!"

My biggest gripe with the Mac app is unlike its iOS variant it can't handle a lot of messages. While the use case for Slack at my workplace involves automatic logging from multiple bots it lags and crashes solely because it uses Electron (a chromium fork). Once we get a native Mac app (and Windows too pleasee while you're at it) I will update this to 5 stars gladly!"

Now the new context menu pops up acting as a search. If I wanted a context menu I'd press a button to open one. If I'm trying to type a slash command assume I know what I'm doing and leave me the heck alone. The way it works now it totally disrupts my workflow so that I don't even want to use slash commands at all.Also markdown in the mobile app doesn't work properly. As an example if I type *this* to bold something it ignores the trailing asterisk and bolds everything.In general the app is also sluggish. Messages often fail to update quickly (like I'll see the current messages on desktop but mobile will be out of sync).For the amount of money Slack charges (for the plan we're on) it's frustrating. Slack hasn't provided anything meaningful to improve the experience. If we didn't have so many third party tools integrated with Slack we'd probably have switched by now."

Updated rating however Dev team should test builds before rolling out to the public especially for important features such as your presence status. Original Review:  Switching between active and away no longer works since the last release. When the selection is chosen it just highlights it but doesn't change the status. Force closing the app and immediately changing the status works only sometimes. I've already tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and the problem still persists. Based upon the reviews in the App Store it appears that this problem is not isolated to me. Hopefully the dev team can fix in the next release"

This should be available in the sidebar as an option but should not have replaced the existing functionality which was much simpler and faster.For example: if you wanted to use Giphy prior to the update you were able to type /giphy [search criteria] submit it and pick a gif you wanted to send. It was clean and simple.This same process now looks like this:Type the slash character which takes you to a fullscreen Shortcuts modal. Search in that menu for Giphy. Tap giphy. Tap if you want to search random or pick a gif. Search within Giphy. Then  tap shuffle as needed. Then finally...send your gif.From a UI/UX perspective simplicity is always a goal but as a general rule if you're adding extra taps/clicks you are likely overthinking the feature and it will be rejected by users. This feature really should have been tested by more general users prior to rollout because there simply isn't enough upside to rollout this feature while eliminating the existing functionality/simplicity.Please move the Shortcuts menu to the sidebar or simply revert."

Previous conversations with other members or groups of members seem to stay listed in the left hand pane with no easy way to clean them up. it would be nice if we can set a time limit after which those historical conversations can at least be archived or moved to a different list that is not normally visible. When I want to send a message to a particular individual or small group I have to use the ad button at the top of the screen multiple times to select those people. It would seem more convenient to me to have that member list be an expandable list on the left-hand side and I simply need to select or check off the members who I intend to send a message to. So basically I think the functionality is great but the organization and layout of the application itself just seems clunky. Even the appearance and spacing of messages and replies isn't usually segregated enough."

And so much content seems to accumulate all over the place and whether there is truly a new message waiting for you or not and where the heck is it is often a mystery. I'll sometimes encounter messages from a colleague or in a team room that are days old and scratch my head why didn't I see these or wasn't notified? I often avoid using Slack and opt to use our simpler internal communications tools because I am afraid messages will just get lost or missed by the receiver   that's a sign of a failed tool.And why isn't a voice integration standard like Microsoft Teams? Some of my company has it set up and some parts don't. Therefore nobody really knows if you cannot cannot do voice calling or meetings in your Slack context/rooms so we simply don't. Which brings me back to simply using our previous corporate tool which does it all seamlessly where I don't miss things and don't have to guess about the functionality and switch in and out of different tools. How Slack can be worth so many billions is beyond belief for a tool that's such a jumbled mess. I guess Salesforce is probably the right owner - another jumbled mess of disorganized and outdated tools that are over-hyped."

Yo to be honest when they first came out with some of newer type features back in the day I thought they were just trying to please to many people BUT....I was wrong. It's incredible and with the custom integrations from everything from HTTP to cal events you're pretty much set I mean I even use the pins to highlight different things my colleagues mention in passing so I can quickly come back or (more honesty) be able to remember those things altogether. Slack honestly has improved my coding productivity we appreciate you guys! We had to tell our CEO today about the good fight and why we pay for slack premium member benefits today and it made me think people ought to know.Thus I'm here writing this review doing my part. Because YAL NEED TO KNOW it's awesome I thank you slack!"

Slack needs to hire someone who knows how to create an easy to use UI. For some unfashionable reason the iOS app splits the list of channels I'm in into two groups: ones that have unread messages and ones that don't.That's not the case with a Mac app.The result is that there's A TON of scrolling back and forth trying to find the channel I'm looking for since it can be in two places: with new messages and without new messages.Then there's starred channels which have the same problem.The UI is a nightmare. I spend more time scrolling through twice as many items on my list of channels than I do on my Macbook! And there's no option in settings to disable this.I'd complained about this issue several years ago - and nothing has changed since then.That's why my company is switching to Microsoft Teams."

        "input": "I have such a deep love-hate relationship with Slack.I only use Slack on iPad and iPhone but mostly on iPad. There are a few key places where it falls down:- Not being able to create/edit Posts is ridiculous. It's just editing text come on.- If you background the app for 30 seconds it marks you as Offline. This means it's hard for my team to tell if I'm actually online or offline as I'm almost always Offline in Slack.- The app needs to be updated to support the iPad pointer natively. It  works' but there's no optimization for it which feels broken compared to any other modern iPadOS app. (Also text selection with the iPad pointer is very difficult because Slack doesn't use native standard elements.)- There's no way to create or reorder Sidebar sections on iPhone/iPad.- Slack actually has great keyboard shortcuts but it's inconsistent with the Mac client. Should let me switch Workspaces and should allow me to Reset Cache.That's all high-level stuff. There are lots of other things I'd like to see but have little-to-no faith that I ever will. For example I'd love for Slack to have Shortcuts support such that I can create an automation that sets my Slack status. That's an example of something I feel like Slack would have jumped on 5ish years ago but doesn't care to do anymore. (Let alone something as fundamental as adopting the system iPad Sidebar or have a native Mac app.)These are all negatives. I actually really like Slack it's a critical business tool for me that I enjoy using. It's just not a joy to use as it continues to drift from what I expect a native iPad app to support."

You'd think that it would be so much easier to use a regular messaging interface but this is atrocious- why not just use Discord? It's literally the same thing without the headaches of random extra steps. Why is it so difficult to join a group it literally doesn't make any sense I have to authenticate my account four or five times for it to just send my in random circles to try and join workspaces AND even then it won't let me join. Horrible app just use iMessage."

I've also noticed in those past five years Slack has barely innovated and as of recently especially during 2020 when most applications like zoom Google meet and Microsoft teams have been booming with innovation in new ways of interacting in this new work from home work life. Now with the acquisition from salesforce I truly feel like Slack is going to go down the drain and what was once the industry leader in communication has sat back on the couch slacking watching everybody else move forward. As of today we are looking into other platforms outside of Slack due to the lack of innovation and buy out from sales force. An example of what I think is easy innovative feedback we've been asking for voice clips to send both privately and in channels up to 2 to 5 minutes long so managers can leave a status update or important message or daily briefing first thing in the morning without having to type it all out and can do it on the go nothing. It was nice while it lasted slack. Ô£ø√º√´√£"

I've been down that rabbit hole with other companies if you need to contact support it's too complicated for the intended use.

Plus it is super user-friendly for those that don't know much (if anything) about technology. If you need a comparison  it's like Reddit for chat. Coders can code and create shortcuts artists can create little emojis to use to react to chats tech novices get a guide to what the tech world looks like without making it too complex to use... I use it for an online bootcamp a class of about 20 people (plus teachers and TAs) and it's has got to be the best way to organize! Set reminders for a class or for yourself in the app create a group giving who you choose more access to to edit the chats (like admins) ask questions easily using /create_ticket set up automated bots to notify you whenever a tag (like /create_ticket) is used so that you can help quickly and keep organized etc..It is truly an app that is perfect for school or work chatting. No stress for not-so-tech-savvy types but as you learn or if you're more advanced it will follow your command."

Isn't it a basic rule of app and UI/UX design to avoid making the user tap and click extra to get to the good stuff?There's no paywall so why change the nature of how Slack loads and what screen it loads to? Why add extra steps for the user to get where they want to go?I otherwise really like Slack I like making custom emojis and it's become a major messaging app for me and friends.However 1-star for Slack adding more sifting through and clicking and waiting for things to load then clicking into names every time. It's a totally unnecessary frustration.Also intermittent glitches on iOS that don't seem to read a long press on the most recently sent message and sometimes just one in a batch of messages any reason for this? It's a new iOS problem in 2020."

So if I don't what to see messages except for direct replies or @ mentions in a group channel I have to edit the setting on every channel someone puts me on. Bottom line is my phone is dinging every second. I silence that channel and someone puts me on a new channel my phone is dinging again."

Slack is very intuitive and easy to use."

And have the ability to format the whiteboard however you wanted so to speak like an excel sheet with checkboxes. Or even if it just had a message at the top people could add to it and there's only a certain amount of lines as determined by the creator of the channel. And people could add emojis to a row of more emojis or something to that effect."

It offers modest boosts in communications but at the expense of constant nagging at all hours to participate in the always-on business culture. If you're going to use slack set up your own boundaries and work to limit the application's reach into your life. Otherwise you'll be sucked up like another strand of spaghetti in Slack's value proposition. Yikes! Boundaries are healthy people. Always on work culture is a sign of simplistic juvenile notions of how to lash as many people as possible into the heaving soul-crushed masses of American suckers who think they have no other option than to just give their lives away to the job market.  Yikes! Boundaries! Cultivate good boundaries! Then maybe slack will actually start to show some value. /end rant."

I liked how the DMs weren't their separate tab and were on the same section as the channel names. I also use Slack on Windows. The difference in UI format between my PC and iPhone will be hard to get adjusted to. I wish they were consistent. I actually feel this new iPhone format is less user friendly/intuitive if users have used the app before.Edit: I've noticed that I don't always get notifications (dot on the workspace icon or bolded slack channel) for new messages so I have to go through all the channels to ensure I don't miss anything."

This built confidence and camaraderie which gives the team a feeling of family during a time we can't work together.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Slack. It caters to all levels of tech abilities super simple and savvy!!"

No joke i invited a dozen people to watch me change the password on the computer (since that's where our work emails are) and then...the app says wrong password. Despite a dozen people having just watched me set the password with the password I then tried to log in on. Slackbot is an affront to technology and a waste of resources. The app itself crashes constantly the ability to actually reply to a thread or navigate in a way that makes sense is completely non-existent.  If you're an individual get the original. If you're a company well the original app this was cloned from is free and works significantly better."

Many of our team are mobile and while the developers themselves are most always at a desktop managers and attendees on calls are not - and are unable to view and follow along on the product and issue demos.  Because of this meetings are now scheduled outside slack on other services like MS teams and GoToMeeting which support viewing from iPad. Once meetings started to move from slack more communications continue to move out.  Our use case makes sharing from iOS a very very low priority but viewing other presenters shared screen is a must have.  Without this feature I find I must only give slack 3 stars.  Otherwise notifications work well and messages are solid other than missing multiple levels of bullet indents to make readable lists."

Now I have to look for my message and I feel that it's not user friendly because now you have to go all the way to the top almost to get back to your message in progress. Also through the app I can't find how to set myself to away without having to snooze myself. Thank you!"

I have to first download? Why can't I drag an image from the web straight into slack? I have to first download it then find the file and upload into slack???Finally: Overall bugginess. Almost every day I have to quit and restart slack (Mac) because it is doing some wonky thing. Not answering calls no audio not calling someone else correctly on the iOS app I tap hang up a call 4-5 times and it slack just sits there with its mouth hanging open doing nothing. With all this said I have no viable alternative to this essential tool and couldn't live without it. I just feel like (as Steve Jobs once said about Adobe Flash) their developers are LAZY."

Well recently I have seen feature changes that just make it harder to use. For example typing slash to run a command now brings up some dialog box to help you but its janky and clumsy and I was fine with just typing. I used to be able to swipe between chats with two fingers. When i am talking to multiple groups a lot this was a god send. This doesn't work now and i have to go find each conversation in a list when i want to switch. Super annoying to have time savers be changed or removed. It is so much more noticeable than when a new feature that works well gets added."

Can't move channels and organize (they're in alphabetical order)    You can't make channels that are visible but locked to everyone. Especially annoying for channels like announcements and rules where I don't want conversations starting.    Paid. I run a little server for local teenagers we can't afford any of the paid plans. The server is active and bustling but soon we'll run out of visible archive space and won't be able to view old material or conversation.    iOS has been buggy for me I'll see a message but Slack won't erase the notification or acknowledge that I've read the message. Only happens once or twice a month but still irritating."

Notification: replying to a notification looks like it's working but the reply never actually goes anywhere. Recipients often think i'm being unresponsive but it's just Slack slacking (as usual). Other products are starting to encroach on Slack and soon we will be using so many others to fill in the bugs and gaps in Slack that we will just stop using Slack. We are a paid team.Update: Now video on the iPad freezes constantly. This is with all parties having solid connections. Terrible and getting worse."

I  have two different  company slacks on my account and I wish there was more flexibility to differentiate notifications between organizations.

I don't habitually check this app daily- that's WHY I have all notifications: banners badges sounds- turned on for this app so I don't miss anything important for my work. Except they don't work. I only sporadically get notifications for new activity and it's usually after I've already opened the app unprompted that the notifications suddenly appear all at once. It's annoying ineffectual and has made me look less than great at work on a few occasions now. If it weren't for the fact that my whole organization uses this app I would never use or recommend it. Fix your game Slack."

I love how i can change my profile picture name workplace info choose privacy and notification settings can set myself as away and all my notifications come in once I'm active have a dark mode enabled (this saves my tired eyes first thing in the morning) and an all the way around fun place to communicate with others.I don't leave many reviews and this is one of the only reviews I've left.
